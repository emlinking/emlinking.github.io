  <h1>Week 2 (May 23-27, 2022)</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>This week I solidified my understanding of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805">BERT</a> 
and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Transformer architecture</a>. With
the help of some tutorials from Professor Ordóñez-Román, I practiced finetuning
models like ResNet and BERT for image and text classification on
datasets like <a href="https://vision.princeton.edu/projects/2010/SUN/">SUN</a>
and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01992">MM-IMDb</a>. We spent some of our meetings
this week reviewing these tutorials.</p>

<p>One of the most challenging exercises was to customize and train a CNN
for scene classification with PyTorch, improving upon a basic model that initially
only had 30% maximum accuracy on the validation set so that it could achieve at least 50% accuracy. 
From this exercise I emerged with a better understanding of the convolution operation, batch 
normalization, and image augmentation. I also got a lot more practice with
PyTorch syntax and commonly used functions/methods.</p>

<p>I ran into issues with GPU and RAM usage limits on Google Collab, which made me
appreciate all the more getting access to the vislang lab servers this week.
With some Linux CLI pointers from Professor Ordóñez-Román, now I can run scripts 
(and even remotely run Jupyter notebooks) via VPN connection to Rice. 
I did have a bit of a problem with matching my installations
of PyTorch and CUDA to the lab machines’ GPU’s at first, but was able to fix this
after some sleuthing on StackOverflow. In general, I got a lot more practice
with package managers (pip, anaconda), setting up and properly using virtual
environments, and the Jupyter Lab interface.</p>

<p>Another stumbling block was running out of space on one of the lab servers. 
Luckily, there are two servers, and for now I can use the other one.</p>

<p>In our last meeting this afternoon, Professor Ordóñez-Román and I discussed next
steps for choosing a dataset and image complexity metric for my project (identifying
complex images by their textual descriptions). Before
our next meeting I’ll be reading more papers on possible datasets to use and
taking notes on important information like size, availability of captions, etc.,
as well as different definitions of “complexity.” Once we choose a dataset, I’ll
need to do some preliminary inspection of the data and generate summary statistics like
average caption length. Depending on the dataset, we may have to collect our own
caption/image descriptions or generate complexity scores, since not all datasets
have all the components necessary for the task as formulated.</p>

<p>I also attended the DREU Kick-off Webinar this afternoon, which introduced us to
some helpful tips for getting the most out of this program. Additionally, I got
my housing assignment at Rice this week and more information on how to access things
like laundry and the dining halls (hard to believe I’ll be there in just over 
two weeks!) My assigned dorm is even near the Computer Science Department building.</p>
