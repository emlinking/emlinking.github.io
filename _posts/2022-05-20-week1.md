title: Week 1 (May 16-20, 2022)
---

This week, I met with Professor Ordóñez-Román to discuss possible projects for the summer and set up regular meeting times for every week. 
Right now we're meeting twice per week online (plus communicating via email), but I'm looking forward to coming to Rice in June.

The project idea we decided on was identifying complex images using their written descriptions. 
This week, I spent a lot of time reading papers to familiarize myself with datasets we might use for this purpose, 
e.g., [SAVOIAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01771) and [MS-COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home), both of which provide complex images with text descriptions.
I also read about some of the metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, CIDEr) used by the creators of MS-COCO to evaluate image captions.

I also familiarized myself with basic machine learning, NLP, and CV concepts (e.g., goals and tasks in NLP/CV, stochastic gradient descent, 
supervised v. unsupervised learning, different types of neural network architectures, convolution, word embeddings) with the help of some lectures 
recommended by Professor Ordóñez-Román from his [Deep Learning for Vision and
Language](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vo9/deep-vislang/) course. 
This was definitely a challenge, since I've never taken a course in machine learning before,
but I found it helpful to do some additional reading online for clarification as well as refer to the papers cited in the lectures. 
In our next meeting, I plan to ask some questions about Transformer architecture, as I still find this topic confusing.

To-dos for next week:
- Read about [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)
- Practice using BERT for text classification: Professor Ordóñez-Román shared a helpful Google Collab notebook with an assignment that walks through 
the steps of this process (loading the dataset, training the model). I've gotten through the section on how to implement a dataset class so far.
