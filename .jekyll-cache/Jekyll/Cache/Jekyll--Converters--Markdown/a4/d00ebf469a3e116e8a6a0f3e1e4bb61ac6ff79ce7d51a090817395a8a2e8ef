I"Å<p>This week, I met with Professor OrdÃ³Ã±ez-RomÃ¡n to discuss possible projects for the summer and set up regular meeting times for every week. Right now weâ€™re meeting online, but Iâ€™m looking forward to coming to Rice in June.</p>

<p>The project idea we decided on was identifying complex image using their written descriptions. This week, I spent a lot of time reading papers to familiarize myself with datasets we might use for this purpose</p>
