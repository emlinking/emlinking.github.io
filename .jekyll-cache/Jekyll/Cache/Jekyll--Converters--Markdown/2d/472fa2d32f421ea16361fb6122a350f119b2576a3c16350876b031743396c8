<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>I am a rising junior (graduating in spring 2024) double-majoring in computer science and linguistics at Columbia University, in New York City. I am interested in computational linguistics/natural language processing, and have previously conducted related research in the Speech Lab at Columbia’s Department of Computer Science and in the Corter Lab at Columbia University Teachers College. This summer, I am conducting research in the <a href="https://www.vislang.ai/">Vision, Language, and Learning Lab</a> at Rice University, with Professor Vicente Ordoñez-Román.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Vicente Ordóñez-Román is Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rice University. His research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning. His focus is on building efficient visual recognition models that can perform tasks that leverage both images and text. He is a recipient of a Best Paper Award at the conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) 2017 and the Best Paper Award – Marr Prize at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2013. He has also been the recipient of an NSF CAREER Award, an IBM Faculty Award, a Google Faculty Research Award, and a Facebook Research Award. From 2016-2021, he was Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. Vicente obtained his PhD in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2015, an MS at Stony Brook University, and an engineering degree at the Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral in Ecuador. In the past, he has also been a visiting researcher at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a visiting professor at Adobe Research.</p>

<h2 id="about-my-project">About My Project</h2>

<p>This summer, I am studying the relationship between visual and linguistic complexity. My project lies at the intersection of natural language processing with computer vision. Since computer vision models often struggle to detect objects in complex images (e.g., those that are “cluttered” or contain many different objects), it could be useful to develop a model for identifying complex images. One possible application of such a model would be to inform users when a CV model’s predictions are more/less trustworthy. Since many images have accompanying written descriptions, we may be able to identify complex images using this text.</p>
