I"*<p>This week, I met with Professor Ordóñez-Román to discuss possible projects for the summer and set up regular meeting times for every week. Right now we’re meeting online, but I’m looking forward to coming to Rice in June.</p>

<p>The project idea we decided on was identifying complex image using their written descriptions. This week, I spent a lot of time reading papers to familiarize myself with datasets we might use for this purpose, e.g., SAVOIAS and the MS COCO dataset, both of which provide complex images with text descriptions.</p>
