<blockquote>
  <p>Vicente Ordóñez-Román is Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rice University. His research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning. His focus is on building efficient visual recognition models that can perform tasks that leverage both images and text. He is a recipient of a Best Paper Award at the conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) 2017 and the Best Paper Award – Marr Prize at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2013. He has also been the recipient of an NSF CAREER Award, an IBM Faculty Award, a Google Faculty Research Award, and a Facebook Research Award. From 2016-2021, he was Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. Vicente obtained his PhD in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2015, an MS at Stony Brook University, and an engineering degree at the Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral in Ecuador. In the past, he has also been a visiting researcher at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a visiting professor at Adobe Research.</p>
