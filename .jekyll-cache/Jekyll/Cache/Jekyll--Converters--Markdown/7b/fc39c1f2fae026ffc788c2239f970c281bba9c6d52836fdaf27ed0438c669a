<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>I am a rising junior (graduating in spring 2024) double-majoring in linguistics and computer science, on the intelligent
systems track, at Columbia University, in New York City. I am interested in computational linguistics/natural language processing. 
At Columbia, I have worked as a research assistant in the <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/areas/speech/">Speech Lab</a>, 
in the Department of Computer Science, and in the <a href="https://www.tc.columbia.edu/faculty/jec34/">Corter Lab</a>, in the 
Cognitive Science in Education program at Teachers College. I have also worked as a data annotator for the <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/areas/speech/">Natural 
Language Processing Group</a> at Columbia. This summer, I am conducting research 
in the <a href="https://www.vislang.ai/">Vision, Language, and Learning Lab</a> at Rice University, with Professor <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vo9/">Vicente 
Ord√≥√±ez-Rom√°n</a>.</p>

<h2 id="about-my-mentor">About My Mentor</h2>

<p>This official bio is from Professor Ord√≥√±ez-Rom√°n‚Äôs <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vo9/">website</a>:</p>

<p>Vicente Ord√≥√±ez-Rom√°n is Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rice University. His research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning. His focus is on building efficient visual recognition models that can perform tasks that leverage both images and text. He is a recipient of a Best Paper Award at the conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) 2017 and the Best Paper Award ‚Äì Marr Prize at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2013. He has also been the recipient of an NSF CAREER Award, an IBM Faculty Award, a Google Faculty Research Award, and a Facebook Research Award. From 2016-2021, he was Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. Vicente obtained his PhD in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2015, an MS at Stony Brook University, and an engineering degree at the Escuela Superior Polit√©cnica del Litoral in Ecuador. In the past, he has also been a visiting researcher at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a visiting professor at Adobe Research.</p>

<h2 id="about-my-project">About My Project</h2>

<p>This summer, I am studying the relationship between visual and linguistic complexity. 
My project lies at the intersection of natural language processing and computer vision. 
Since computer vision models often struggle to detect objects in complex images 
(e.g., those that are ‚Äúcluttered‚Äù or contain many different objects), it could be useful 
to develop a model for identifying complex images. One possible application of such a model 
would be to inform users when a CV model‚Äôs predictions are more/less trustworthy. Since many images 
have accompanying written descriptions, we may be able to identify complex images using this text.</p>

<p>The goals/plans for this project are to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use object detectors to identify difficult/complex images.</li>
  <li>Determine if a text-based classifier is able to distinguish complex and non-complex images identified in (1), 
using the image descriptions/captions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Through this project, I hope to explore my interest in machine learning, especially natural language processing, 
as well as explore the interface of NLP and computer vision.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-dreu-program">About the DREU Program</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://cra.org/cra-wp/dreu/">Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates</a> (DREU) program aims to increase the diversity of computer science/engineering graduate students by matching students with faculty mentors at institutions across the United States for a 10-week, fully funded summer research experience. DREU is organized by the Computing Research Association‚Äôs Committee on Widening Participation in Computing Research (CRA-WP) and supported by the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503593">National Science Foundation</a>.</p>
