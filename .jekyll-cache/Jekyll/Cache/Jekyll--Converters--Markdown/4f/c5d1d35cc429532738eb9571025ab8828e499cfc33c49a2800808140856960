I"ë<p>This week, I met with Professor Ord√≥√±ez-Rom√°n to discuss possible projects for the summer and set up regular meeting times for every week. 
Right now we‚Äôre meeting online, but I‚Äôm looking forward to coming to Rice in June.</p>

<p>The project idea we decided on was identifying complex image using their written descriptions. 
This week, I spent a lot of time reading papers to familiarize myself with datasets we might use for this purpose, 
e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01771">SAVOIAS</a> and <a href="https://cocodataset.org/#home">MS-COCO</a>, both of which provide complex images with text descriptions.</p>

<p>I also familiarized myself with basic machine learning concepts (stochastic gradient descent, supervised v. unsupervised learning, 
different types of neural network architectures) with the help of some lectures recommended by Professor Ord√≥√±ez-Rom√°n from his <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vo9/deep-vislang/">Deep Learning for Vision and
Language</a> course. This was definitely a challenge, since I‚Äôve never taken a course in machine learning before,
but I found it helpful to do some additional reading online for</p>
