## 2022 Undergraduate Research Symposium, Columbia University

I presented my work at Columbia's 2022 [Undergraduate Research Symposium](https://urf.columbia.edu/urf/research/Ugrad-symposium) in October. Click [here](files/abstract_visual_complexity_lin_2022.pdf) for the poster abstract and [here](files/poster_visual_complexity_lin_2022.pdf) for the poster.

- “Text-Based Prediction of Visual Complexity: How Does What We See Influence What We Say?” presented at the Columbia University Undergraduate Research Symposium, New York, NY, United States, Oct. 21, 2022. Abstract available: https://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/undergraduate-research/files/2022/10/Research-Symposium-Abstract-Booklet-2022-FINAL-2.pdf

## About Me

I am a rising junior (graduating in spring 2024) double-majoring in linguistics and computer science on the intelligent
systems track at Columbia University, in New York City. I am interested in computational linguistics/natural language processing. 
At Columbia, I have worked as a research assistant in the [Speech Lab](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/areas/speech/), 
in the Department of Computer Science, and in the [Corter Lab](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/faculty/jec34/), in the 
Cognitive Science in Education program at Teachers College. I have also worked as a data annotator for the [Natural 
Language Processing Group](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/areas/speech/) at Columbia. This summer, I am conducting research 
in the [Vision, Language, and Learning Lab](https://www.vislang.ai/) at Rice University, with Professor [Vicente 
Ordóñez-Román](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vo9/).

## About My Mentor

This official bio is from Professor Ordóñez-Román's [website](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vo9/):

Vicente Ordóñez-Román is Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rice University. His research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing and machine learning. His focus is on building efficient visual recognition models that can perform tasks that leverage both images and text. He is a recipient of a Best Paper Award at the conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) 2017 and the Best Paper Award -- Marr Prize at the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2013. He has also been the recipient of an NSF CAREER Award, an IBM Faculty Award, a Google Faculty Research Award, and a Facebook Research Award. From 2016-2021, he was Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. Vicente obtained his PhD in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2015, an MS at Stony Brook University, and an engineering degree at the Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral in Ecuador. In the past, he has also been a visiting researcher at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and a visiting professor at Adobe Research.

## About My Project

This summer, I am studying the relationship between visual and linguistic complexity. 
My project lies at the intersection of natural language processing and computer vision. 
Since computer vision models often struggle to perform tasks like object detection on complex images, it could be useful 
to develop a model for identifying complex images. One possible application of such a model 
would be to inform users when a CV model's predictions are more/less trustworthy. Since many images 
have accompanying written descriptions, we may be able to identify complex images using this text.

The goals/plans for this project are to:
1. Develop an automated metric to identify difficult/complex images.
2. Determine if a text-based model is able to distinguish complex and non-complex images identified in (1), 
using the image descriptions/captions.

Through this project, I hope to explore my interest in machine learning, especially natural language processing, 
as well as explore the interface of NLP and computer vision.

## About the DREU Program

The [Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates](https://cra.org/cra-wp/dreu/) (DREU) program aims to increase the diversity of computer science/engineering graduate students by matching students with faculty mentors at institutions across the United States for a 10-week, fully funded summer research experience. DREU is organized by the Computing Research Association's Committee on Widening Participation in Computing Research (CRA-WP) and supported by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503593).
